# TumorID_Updated_Classifiers
This is an updated TumorID Simulator based on simulation parameters posed for a tape boundary experiment. A number of different classifiers are implemented that depend on different wavelengths, and also there are scripts here to show the effects of changes in step size, int time, and other things.
